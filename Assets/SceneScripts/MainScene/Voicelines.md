Total voicelines: 39

## How to Play
- "You can use your typical WASD keys to move around, and the mouse to look around. Use the spacebar to jump, the left mouse button to grapple onto objects, and \"E\" to interact with objects. Good luck out there."

## Starter dialogue
- "Welcome to the simulation! Or, as we like to call it, the "game!"
- "Beyond the next horizon lies a challenge untold. Will you rise as the tide, or like so many before, recede into the Dangerous Depths?" *
- "You're just here to collect some tokens, right? Easy peasy!" *
- "Oh, did I mention that water will be constantly rising? You'll need to keep moving around to dodge it."
- "You can collect powerful tokens scattered seldomly around the map to fight back against the water."
- "A word of warning, every time you collect a token, the physics of this simulation - I mean, game - will change. Be careful!"

## Gameplay dialogue
- "The simulation will end and you will be extracted back to reality in ten minutes. That is, unless you become enveloped first..."
- "You're halfway there!"
- "Just one singular token remains, a key to your return. Can you claim it?" *
- "All tokens have been collected! We're sending the extraction team now, give us a minute..."
- "Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One...!"
- "Initiating countdown: Ten to one, let's reverse the run. Ready to return to where we begun?" *
- "Congratulations! You've made it out alive!"
- "Thanks for playing!"
- "The simulation has ended. Want to play again?"

## Token pickup VO
- "You've picked up a token! The simulation will change..." *
- "Another token! The simulation will change..." *
- "Wow, you're on a roll!" *
- "Oooh, this is getting interesting..."
- "Oh yeah! Keep it up!"
- "You're doing great!" *
- "You're unstoppable!" 
- "Boom! Another token!" *
- "A token in hand, the world expands. A leap, a stand, fate's in your hands."
- "A token caught, the plot thickens, in this game, there are no givens." *
- "A token more, the stakes are high, beneath the surface, truths lie." *

## Water rising damage VO
- "The water's rising!"
- "This doesn't look good..."
- "You're getting wet!"
- "You're taking critical damage!"
- "Get to higher ground!"
- "Get to higher ground ASAP!"
- "Get out of the water!"
- "You're drowning!"
- "You don't want to be underwater for too long!"
- "You don't have gills, you know!" *
- "You're not a fish!" *
- "Ouch! That looked painful. Perhaps consider a strategy that involves less... submersion?" *
